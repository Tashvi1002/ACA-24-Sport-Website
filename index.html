            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad, India to P. V. Ramana and P. Vijaya.
                Ramana, an employee of the Indian Railways, was born in Nirmal, Telangana while Vijaya hails from
             Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. Both her parents have been national level volleyball players.
             Her father, Ramana, who was a member of the Indian volleyball team that won the bronze medal in
              1986 Seoul Asian Games, received the Arjuna Award in 2000 for his contribution to the sport</p>
              <br><br>
              <p>Pusarla lives in Hyderabad, Telangana. She was educated at Auxilium High School, Hyderabad
                  and at St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad. Though her parents played professional
                  volleyball, she chose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of
                   Pullela Gopichand, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion.She eventually started
                    playing badminton from the age of eight. She first learned the basics of the sport with
                 the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering
                  and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy</p>
                  <br><br>
            <p>
                Gopichand seconded this correspondent's opinion when he said that "the most striking feature in Sindhu's game is her
             attitude and the never-say-die spirit." After joining Gopichand's badminton academy, Pusarla won several titles. In the
              under-10 years category, she won the 5th Servo All India ranking championship in the doubles category and the singles
               title at the Ambuja Cement All India ranking. In the under-13 years category, she won the singles title at the Sub-juniors
                in Pondicherry, doubles titles at the Krishna Khaitan All India Tournament IOC All India Ranking, the Sub-Junior Nationals
             and the All India Ranking in Pune. She also won the under-14 team gold medal at the 51st National State Games in India.
              She later parted company with Gopichand and chose South Korean coach Park Tae-sang.
